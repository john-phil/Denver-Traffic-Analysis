- Derived new variables
  - Created a new column, 'Fatality_injury Index' to have a composite number reflecting the sum of all fatalities and serious injuries from accidents.

- Grouped and aggregated data
  - Created new flags to assist with analysis
  - Created summary columns of descriptive statistics using the groupby() function
###  Used data visualization in Tableau
  - Created histograms, bar charts, and line charts to help communicate the key findings.
